This set of scripts splits transcript sequence fasta files by window lengths and then merges the results of culstering to parallelise the computation of ICE.


############################################################
ice_cycle_split.py:
This script takes a single fasta file as input as well as window and overlap length. It outputs mutliple fasta files based on the different window length splits. 

usage: ice_cycle_split.py [-h] [-f F] [-w W] [-o O] [-p P]

F - Fasta file containing transcript sequences
W - Window size for length of sequences
O - Overlap size for length of sequences
P - Prefix for output split fasta files

############################################################
ice_cycle_recover.py:
This script recovers transcript sequences which may not have been completely clustered due to length cut-offs from file splitting. 

usage: ice_cycle_recover.py [-h] [-r R] [-f F] [-o O]

R - File with list of cluster report csv files

For example:
path/to/file/cluster_report.FL.csv

F - File with list of split fasta files used for clustering

For example:
path/to/file/flnc_0_600.fa

O - Output fasta file name

############################################################
ice_cycle_merge.py:
This script merges all the clustering results.

usage: ice_cycle_merge.py [-h] [-rr RR] [-rf RF] [-sf SF] [-cr CR] [-cf CF] [-p P]

RR - Recover cluster report csv file
RF - Recover cluster fasta file

SF - File list of fasta files for split run inputs

For example:
path/to/file/flnc_0_600.fa

CR - File list of cluster report csv files for split runs

For example:
path/to/file/cluster_report.FL.csv

CF - File list of cluster fasta files for split run outputs

For example:
path/to/file/final.consensus.fasta

P -  Prefix for output files
